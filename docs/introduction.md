## Introduction

Printing for Laravel allows your application to directly send PDF documents or raw text directly from a remote server to a printer on your local network.
Receipts can also be printed by first generating the raw text via the `Rawilk\Printing\Receipts\ReceiptPrinter` class, and then sending the text as a
raw print job via the `Printing` facade.

Here's a simple example of what you can do with this package:

```php
use Rawilk\Printing\Facades\Printing;

$printJob = Printing::newPrintTask()
    ->printer($printerId)
    ->file('path_to_file.pdf')
    ->send();

$printJob->id(); // the id number returned from the print server
```

> {note} Version 4.x is in a pre-release state currently. It is considered mostly stable, however breaking changes may be introduced as bugs are discovered and fixed. I will do my best however to prevent any breaking changes though.

## Supported Drivers

Laravel Printing currently only supports one two drivers currently. More drivers may be added in the future.

- [PrintNode](https://printnode.com)
