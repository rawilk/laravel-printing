## Introduction

A print task is used to send and print a document on the printer.

Print tasks can be sent to your printer by creating a new print task. At the bare minimum, you need your printer's id, and the content you are going to print.

```php
use Rawilk\Printing\Facades\Printing;

Printing::newPrintTask()
    ->printer($printerId)
    ->file('path_to_file.pdf')
    ->send();
```

## Options

There are several options you can set for a print job. You should consult with your print driver to see which options you have available to you.

```php
Printing::newPrintTask()
    ->printer($printerId)
    ->file('path_to_file.pdf')
    ->jobTitle('my job title')
    ->option('fit_to_page', true) // 'fit_to_page' is an available PrintNode option
    ->copies(2)
    ->tray('Tray 1') // check if your driver and printer supports this
    ->send();
```

Depending on the driver being used, there may be additional methods and even parameters to some of the standard methods shown above. Be sure to consult the documentation for your chosen driver to see what is available in the driver's print task api.

### Driver Options

- See [PrintNode PrintTask](/docs/laravel-printing/{version}/printnode/print-task) for more options for the PrintNode driver.
- See [CUPS PrintTask](/docs/laravel-printing/{version}/cups/print-task) for more options for the CUPS driver.

## Conditionable

The base `PrintTask` class has been made `Conditionable`, so certain methods can be conditionally applied through `when`.

```php
use Rawilk\Printing\PrintTask;

Printing::newPrintTask()
    ->when(
        $someCondition === true,
        fn (PrintTask $task) => $task->content('...')
    )
```
